Intro - A child inherits many traits from his/her biological parents. Intelligence is considered one of the most
heritable traits. It is a complex human trait, influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Intelligence
can be thought of as the ability to learn and solve complex problems by adapting to the evolving environment.
Intelligence quotient (IQ) is one of the measures of this ability. The heritability of IQ has been a burning
research topic since the nineteenth century.
